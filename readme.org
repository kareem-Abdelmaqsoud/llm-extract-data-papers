#+title: LLM extract data from tables in PDFs

* Setup in uv

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
uv venv --python=3.12
source .venv/bin/activate
uv run streamlit run app.py
#+END_SRC

Lightly tested. Sometimes only finds one table, not tested on very long documents.

* Notes

leaves temp pdf files around, i don't know why that is necessary. If it is because you don't have a path, then these should be saved in a tempfile.

Untested, but something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import tempfile
import os

with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix=".pdf", delete=False) as pdf_path:
    with open(pdf_path, "wb") as f:
        f.write(uploaded_file.getbuffer())
    return pdf_path
#+END_SRC

These will be automatically cleaned up by the OS eventually.

But, why not use an actual path and just read the file you have? I am sure there is a way to get that.
